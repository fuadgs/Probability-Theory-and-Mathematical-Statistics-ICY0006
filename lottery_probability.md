Probability of winning of Mega Millions https://www.megamillions.com/

Mega Millions is an American multi-jurisdictional lottery game.

Mega Millions jackpot grows until it is won. Players select five numbers from 1 to 75 and one Powerball number from 1 to 15. Players can multiply non-jackpot prizes by 2, 3, 4, 5 times with the Megaplier option for an additional $1 per play.

Mega Millions winners have either 180 days (California non-jackpot prizes only) or one year to claim prizes, including the jackpot (although some Mega Millions winners lose the right to collect a jackpot in cash if they wait more than 60 days after the drawing).


We will measure the likelihood of the winning conditions by using the formula below, and check the results against the numbers posted on Wikipedia.

n! / r! (n-r)!
Here n is amount of numbers in the pool to select from (e.g. in this game 75 or 15 for Mega Millions). r is how many we can select (e.g. 5 or 1 for Mega Millions number).

1. 5 + 1 - all five numbers and Mega Ball are correctly guessed in this scenario and jackpot is won
The odd for winning is 1 in 258,890,850. We calculcate that number as follows:

75! / 5! * (75 - 5)! = 17,259,390
The above is the number of combinations. For mega ball the probability is 1/15 and 15 combinations.
Therefore, five numbers plus mega ball numbers you need to multiply the above calculations:

1 / 17,259,390 * 1 / 15 = 1 / 258,890,850
This is the probability of winning this lottery.

2. 5 + 0 - all five numbers have to be guessed and Mega Ball not guessed
The probability to guess 5 numbers is the same as above:

1/17,259,390
There are 15-1=14 incorrect combinations not to guess Mega Ball number. So, the probablity is 14/15.

The final calculations are as follows:

1 / 17,259,390 * 14 / 15 = 14/ 258,890,850 = 1/18,492,203.57 = 1/18,492,204
3. 4 + 1 - guess 4 out of 5 selected numbers + Mega Ball number
The number of combinations is 17,259,390 as calculated before. Mega Ball probability: 1/15 The 4 out of 5 combinations calculations are below:

5!/4!*1! * 70!/69!*1! = 350
Finally, the probability of 4 + 1 winning combinations is:

350 * 1/17,259,390 * 1/15 = 1/739,688.14 = 1/739,688
4. 4 + 0 - guess 4 out of 5 selected numbers and no powerball number
Following the logic above:

350 * 1/17,259,390 * 14/15 = 1/52,834.86 = 1/52,835 
5. 3 + 1
The 3 out of 5 combinations calculations are below:

5!/3!*2! * 70!/68!*2! = 24,150
Finally, the probability of 3 + 1 winning combinations is:

24,150 * 1/17,259,390* 1/15 = 1/10,720.11 = 1/10,720
6. 3 + 0
The probability of 3 + 0 winning combinations is:

24,150 * 1/17,259,390 * 14/15 = 1/765.72 = 1/766
7. 2 + 1
The 2 out of 5 combinations calculations are below:

5!/2!*3! * 70!/67!*3! = 547,400
Finally, the probability of 2 + 1 winning combinations is:

547,400 * 1/17,259,390 * 1/15 = 1/472.94 = 1/473
8. 1 + 1
The 1 out of 5 combinations calculations are below:

5!/1!*4! * 70!/66!*4! = 4,584,475
Finally, the probability of 1 + 1 winning combinations is:

4,584,475 * 1/17,259,390 * 1/15 = 1/56.47 = 1/56
9. 0 + 1
The number of ways in which no numbers are chosen correctly out of 5 numbers calculations are below:

5!/0!*5! * 70!/65!*5! = 12,113,014
Finally, the probability of 0 + 1 winning combinations is:

12,113,014 * 1/17,259,390 * 1/15 = 1/21.39 = 1/21
