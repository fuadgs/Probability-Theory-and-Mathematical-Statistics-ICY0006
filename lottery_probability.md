Probability of winning of Mega Millions https://www.megamillions.com/
Mega Millions is an American  multi-jurisdictional lottery game.

Mega Millions jackpot grows until it is won. Players select five numbers from 1 to 75 and one Powerball number from 1 to 15. Players can multiply non-jackpot prizes by 2, 3, 4, 5 times with the Megaplier option for an additional $1 per play.

Mega Millions winners have either 180 days (California non-jackpot prizes only) or one year to claim prizes, including the jackpot (although some Mega Millions winners lose the right to collect a jackpot in cash if they wait more than 60 days after the drawing).


We will measure the likelihood of the winning conditions by using the formula below, and check the results against the numbers posted on Wikipedia.

n! / r! (n-r)!
Here n is amount of numbers in the pool to select from (e.g. in this game 69 or 26 for Powerball). r is how many we can select (e.g. 5 or 1 for Powerball number).

1. 5 + 1 - all five numbers and powerball are correctly guessed in this scenario and jackpot is won
The odd for winning is 1 in 292,201,338. We calculcate that number as follows:

69! / 5! * (69 - 5)! = 11,238,513
The above is the number of combinations. For powerball the probability is 1/26 and 26 combinations.
Therefore, five numbers plus powerball numbers you need to multiply the above calculations:

1 / 11,238,513 * 1 / 26 = 1 / 292,201,338
This is the probability of winning this lottery.

2. 5 + 0 - all five numbers have to be guessed and Powerball not guessed
The probability to guess 5 numbers is the same as above:

1/11,238,513
There are 26-1=25 incorrect combinations not to guess Powerball number. So, the probablity is 25/26.

The final calculations are as follows:

1 / 11,238,513 * 25 / 26 = 25/ 292,201,338 = 1/11,688,053.52
3. 4 + 1 - guess 4 out of 5 selected numbers + powerball number
The number of combinations is 11,238,513 as calculated before. Powerball probability: 1/26 The 4 out of 5 combinations calculations are below:

5!/4!*1! * 64!/63!*1! = 320
Finally, the probability of 4 + 1 winning combinations is:

320 * 1/11,238,513 * 1/26 = 1/913,129.18125
4. 4 + 0 - guess 4 out of 5 selected numbers and no powerball number
Following the logic above:

320 * 1/11,238,513 * 25/26 = 36,525.16725
5. 3 + 1
The 3 out of 5 combinations calculations are below:

5!/3!*2! * 64!/62!*2! = 20,160
Finally, the probability of 3 + 1 winning combinations is:

20,160 * 1/11,238,513 * 1/26 = 1/14,494
6. 3 + 0
The probability of 3 + 0 winning combinations is:

20,160 * 1/11,238,513 * 25/26 = 1/579
7. 2 + 1
The 2 out of 5 combinations calculations are below:

5!/2!*3! * 64!/61!*3! = 416,640
Finally, the probability of 2 + 1 winning combinations is:

416,640 * 1/11,238,513 * 1/26 = 1/701.33
8. 1 + 1
The 1 out of 5 combinations calculations are below:

5!/1!*4! * 64!/60!*4! = 3,176,880
Finally, the probability of 1 + 1 winning combinations is:

3,176,880 * 1/11,238,513 * 1/26 = 1/92
9. 0 + 1
The number of ways in which no numbers are chosen correctly out of 5 numbers calculations are below:

5!/0!*5! * 64!/59!*5! = 7,624,512
Finally, the probability of 0 + 1 winning combinations is:

7,624,512 * 1/11,238,513 * 1/26 = 1/38.32
